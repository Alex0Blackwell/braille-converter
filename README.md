## Overview
This website serves as a way to convert and learn braille. The website uses six dots (two columns, three rows) to represent the bumps found on brialle. To represent a *raised* state, the dot turns a dark colour, otherwise the bump is not raised and remains a light colour. The website features to ability to convert braille to and from English alphabet characters. Additionally, you can test yourself and try to beat your own scores!

## Usage
There are three main features of the website:  
- Braille to Alphabet
  - you can press on dots to switch them into their *raised* state, and by pressing *convert* the program will determine what alphabet character is represented
- Test Yourself
  - the program will prompt an alphabet character to be represented. If you correctly submit the alphabet character your time will be compared against your top time ever
  - if the alphabet character entered is wrong, however, the correct character will be shown
- Generate Braille
  - alphabet characters can be typed into a text box and equivalent braille will be displayed below
